## Overview
The report introduces different approaches (deep learning and non deep learning) to a sentiment classification task.

The dataset used is Stanford Sentiment Treebank - Movie Review Classification Competition, where each review contains only one sentence and the sentiment class is polarized: "positive" or "negative".

The training dataset has 6920 rows of data. The classes are pretty balanced so no further processing is needed.
